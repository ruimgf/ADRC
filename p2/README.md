# Static Analysis of Inter-AS Routing
This Project implements:

- an algorithm to check whether a network has customer cycles. 
- an algorithm that receives as input a network and a destination in that network and computes the type of route elected at each node to reach the destination. 
- an algorithm to determine whether a network is commercially connected.
